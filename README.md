# Final paper

This final paper presents the development of a web application for a beauty salon. In 
today's time, almost everyone has access to the Internet, enabling them to access and use 
various web applications. This is precisely why the main goal of this application is to provide 
users with a simple appointment reservation process in just a few steps, without the need to 
personally visit the salon. The application is implemented through various functionalities, 
depending on the roles. 

The Administrator, who is also the salon owner, possesses the 
highest privileges, including user and service management, as well as overseeing the salon's 
reveneu, service demand and employee work. 

An employee can monitor their appointment 
schedule and, if necessary, cancel appointments. 

Each registered user can view and cancel 
their appointments, browse and search for services, and filter services by prices. 

The role 
with the least privileges is the guest role, which can only browse services and employees; 
additional functionalities require registration.. The Django framework and the SQLite 
database management system were used to implement the application. Dynamic effects are 
achieved using JavaScript.
